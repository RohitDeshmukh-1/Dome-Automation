# Dome-Automation
This code is a part of a solution that presents the design and development of an IoT-based automated dome control system for the Vishwaroop Darshan Aryabhatta Observatory at MIT-WPU, Pune. The system integrates a motorized, rotatable dome with telescope tracking to allow precise alignment with celestial objects, improving observation accuracy while minimizing manual intervention. It uses a Raspberry Pi controller, infrared quadrature sensors for angular feedback, and a Hall-effect homing sensor for position calibration, achieving 3.75Â° resolution. A custom Python program with a PID algorithm governs dome movement, while real-time astronomical coordinate transformation ensures accurate tracking. The system demonstrated high performance, stability, and safety during extended tests, supporting remote operation with low latency and efficient power use. Designed to be cost-effective and scalable, it provides a robust, user-friendly solution for small and academic observatories, with future potential for machine learning-based enhancements.
